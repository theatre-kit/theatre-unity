# Theatre Unity — Roadmap

Phased implementation plan. Each phase produces a usable, testable
increment. Phases are sequential — later phases depend on earlier ones.

---

## Phase 0 — Scaffold ✓

Set up the project skeleton. No functionality, just structure.

- [x] Create Unity 6 project as test harness
- [x] Create UPM package skeleton (`com.theatre.toolkit`)
- [x] Add `TheatreServer.cs` stub with `[InitializeOnLoad]`
- [x] Add `HttpListener` lifecycle — bind, listen, shutdown
- [x] Verify server starts on editor load and restarts on domain reload
- [x] Add `/health` endpoint returning `{ "status": "ok" }`
- [ ] CI: GitHub Actions workflow (blocked — requires Unity Pro for batch mode)

---

## Phase 1 — MCP Core ✓

Implement the MCP protocol layer.

- [x] JSON-RPC 2.0 types (`JsonRpcMessage`, `JsonRpcError`, `JsonRpcResponse`)
- [x] MCP handshake (`initialize` / `initialized`)
- [x] `tools/list` — returns registered tools with JSON Schema parameters
- [x] `tools/call` — dispatches to handler by name, returns result
- [x] Tool registry with group-based filtering (`ToolGroup` flags enum)
- [x] `notifications/tools/list_changed` when groups toggle
- [x] `MainThreadDispatcher` — ConcurrentQueue + EditorApplication.update
- [x] `TheatreConfig` — port, enabled groups, per-tool overrides
- [x] SSE endpoint (GET `/mcp`) for server-initiated notifications
- [x] `theatre_status` dummy tool validates full round-trip
- [x] MCP integration tests (HttpClient → JSON-RPC → valid response)

---

## Phase 2 — Stage: Scene Awareness ✓

First real tools. Agent can see the scene.

- [x] `scene_snapshot` — budgeted overview of GameObjects with positions
- [x] `scene_hierarchy` — list, find, search operations
- [x] `scene_inspect` — deep single-object inspection via SerializedProperty
- [x] Object addressing: hierarchy path + instance_id on all responses
- [x] Multi-scene support (`SceneName:/Path` addressing)
- [x] Prefab mode detection and scoping
- [x] Token budgeting engine (estimate, truncate, paginate)
- [x] Pagination with cursors
- [x] Play mode vs edit mode reporting
- [x] Clustering for snapshot summaries
- [x] Test scene with known layout (auto-generated via TestSceneCreator)

---

## Phase 3 — Stage: Spatial Queries ✓

Agent can ask spatial questions.

- [x] `spatial_query:nearest` — N closest objects to a point
- [x] `spatial_query:radius` — all objects within radius
- [x] `spatial_query:overlap` — physics overlap (sphere, box, capsule)
- [x] `spatial_query:raycast` — single and multi-hit
- [x] `spatial_query:linecast` — line-of-sight check
- [x] `spatial_query:path_distance` — NavMesh path distance
- [x] `spatial_query:bounds` — world-space bounding box
- [x] 2D/3D physics toggle (auto-detect + per-query `physics` param)
- [x] Spatial index (flat-list brute force, adequate for typical scenes)
- [x] `requires_play_mode` error for physics queries in edit mode

---

## Phase 4 — Stage: Watches & Actions ✓

Agent can subscribe to changes and manipulate game state.

- [x] `watch:create` — subscribe with conditions (threshold, proximity,
  region, property_changed, destroyed, spawned)
- [x] `watch:remove`, `watch:list`, `watch:check`
- [x] Watch trigger notifications via SSE
- [x] Watch throttling (`throttle_ms`)
- [x] Watch persistence across domain reloads (SessionState)
- [x] `action:teleport` — move GameObject to position
- [x] `action:set_property` — set component property via SerializedProperty
- [x] `action:set_active` — enable/disable GameObject
- [x] `action:set_timescale` — change Time.timeScale
- [x] `action:pause` / `action:step` / `action:unpause`
- [x] `action:invoke_method` — call public methods (simple signatures)
- [x] `scene_delta` — what changed since last query / specific frame

Also implemented (not in original roadmap):
- [x] `unity_console` — read Console log with grep, dedup, rollup, refresh
- [x] `unity_tests` — run EditMode/PlayMode tests and get results via MCP

---

## Phase 5 — Stage: Recording

Dashcam — frame-by-frame capture and temporal analysis.

- [ ] SQLite integration (native binaries in Plugins/)
- [ ] Database schema (frames, markers, metadata)
- [ ] `recording:start` — begin capture with filters
- [ ] `recording:stop` — end capture, return clip metadata
- [ ] `recording:marker` — insert named marker
- [ ] `recording:list_clips` / `recording:delete_clip`
- [ ] `recording:query_range` — query frames in time/frame range
- [ ] `recording:diff_frames` — compare two specific frames
- [ ] `recording:clip_info` / `recording:analyze`
- [ ] Delta compression (only write changed properties per frame)
- [ ] GC-friendly capture (object pooling, reused buffers)
- [ ] Configurable capture rate, max duration
- [ ] Recording survives domain reload (SessionState + SQLite persistence)

**Exit criteria**: Human reproduces a bug, agent scrubs through the
recording to find when and where things went wrong.
